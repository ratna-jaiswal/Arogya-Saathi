Precautions before treating persistent OP or transverse positions include: During the first stage of labor, closely monitor the progress of labor, observing the descent of the fetal head, the degree of cervical dilation, the strength of contractions, and any changes in fetal heart rate. Expect a longer labor and ensure sufficient nutrition and rest for the parturient. Position the parturient on her side facing away from the fetal back to facilitate the rotation of the fetal occiput anteriorly. If contractions are poor, initiate intravenous administration of oxytocin early. Before full dilation of the cervix, advise the parturient against bearing down too early to avoid the swelling of the anterior lip of the cervix that could obstruct labor progression. If there is no significant progress in labor, with the fetal head high or signs of fetal distress, consider cesarean delivery to conclude birth. During the second stage of labor, if progress is slow, with primiparous women nearing 2 hours and multiparous women nearing 1 hour, perform a vaginal examination. When the biparietal diameter of the fetal head has reached the level of the ischial spines or lower, manually rotate the fetal occiput anteriorly to align the fetal sagittal suture with the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet, consider natural delivery, or vaginal assisted delivery (low forceps or vacuum extraction). If rotation to an anterior occiput position is difficult, rotate to a direct occiput posterior position, then assist delivery with forceps. Delivering in an occiput posterior position may require a larger episiotomy to prevent perineal lacerations. If the fetal head is high, suspecting cephalopelvic disproportion, cesarean delivery should be performed, and mid forceps are not advisable. During the third stage of labor, due to prolonged labor, there's a risk of postpartum uterine atony, hence administer uterotonic agents immediately after placental expulsion to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. For patients with soft birth canal injuries, timely suturing is necessary. Newborns should be closely monitored. Postpartum antibiotics should be administered to prevent infection in those who underwent operative delivery or sustained soft birth canal lacerations.\",\n          \"What are the treatment methods for Kashin-Beck Disease? \\nTreatment methods for Kashin-Beck Disease are still under exploration and trial, with definitive conclusions yet to be reached regarding pharmacotherapy. Currently, there is no specific treatment, but based on the understanding of the disease's etiology and pathogenesis along with years of collective prevention and treatment experiences, some medications, auxiliary therapies, and surgical treatments have been identified that can alleviate symptoms, slow down and halt disease progression, promote bone repair, and improve joint function. 1.Pharmacotherapy related to the disease mechanism: These medications are used in early-stage patients, aiming to halt disease progression and promote lesion repair. Commonly used: (1) Sodium selenite and Vitamin E: Employed based on the presence of low selenium changes and membrane damage in patients. Sodium selenite tablets are administered orally, containing 1mg of sodium selenite each, with a dosage of one tablet per week for children under 10 years old and two tablets per week for those older than 10, for at least 6 months. Concurrent use of Vitamin E, 10-20mg daily, can enhance the effect. Studies have shown a treatment efficacy of 81.9% after one year, as judged by changes in the metaphysis under X-ray, which is close to the lesion repair process when patients leave endemic areas. Due to the narrow physiologically appropriate range of selenium, strict dosage control is necessary to prevent misuse. (2) Sulfates: Sulfates play an important role in the formation of chondroitin sulfate within the cartilage matrix; low sulfur can lead to early ossification of cartilage and short-limbed deformity. Sulfate preparations can alleviate symptoms in clinical practice, with X-rays showing restorative effects on metaphyseal lesions. Common medications include sodium sulfate tablets (containing anhydrous sodium sulfate 1.8g, citric acid 0.45g) administered orally twice per day, three tablets each time. (3) Magnesium preparations: Magnesium salts act as activators for alkaline phosphatase. A deficiency in magnesium can lead to bone atrophy and skeletal deformities over time. Treating the disease with magnesium supplements can ease symptoms and aid in the repair of metaphyseal bone quality. Commonly used is magnesium sulfate tablets, 3g per day for adults, divided into three oral doses. (4) Others: Some treatments employ Vitamin C, calcium lactate, and Vitamin D, which have shown good effects. Others like Bai Di Mold, Qian Qian Zi Wan, Xiao Huo Luo Dan, Bone Growth Pills, Shu Jin Huo Xue Tablets, and Shuang Niao Pills can also be used for treatment. 2.Medications for joint pain and movement disorders: Various symptomatic medications can be used for patients at different stages. Common drugs include: (1) NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs): Aspirin or other salicylate preparations are commonly used, reported to not only relieve pain but also inhibit proteolytic enzymes and promote cartilage lesion repair. However, long-term use should be monitored for side effects. New NSAIDs widely used in osteoarthritis, such as Ibuprofen, can also be considered. (2) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): Commonly used include Shuang Wu Pills (composition includes Cao Wu and Chuan Wu), Ma Qian Zi Pills, Zhi Tong Huo Xue San, Xiao Huo Luo Dan, etc. 3.Acupuncture and physiotherapy: Acupuncture and physiotherapy are symptomatic treatments for pain relief, spasm resolution, and joint function improvement. Besides traditional acupuncture, cupping, and massage, mud therapy, wax therapy, mineral baths, thermoelectric stimulation therapy, iontophoresis (using 5% sodium thiosulfate), and external magnetotherapy have been adapted to local conditions, showing good effects in alleviating joint pain. 4.Surgical treatment: For patients with severe involvement of knees, elbows, and below, especially those with stage II and III disease and common hip joint involvement (flexion and adduction deformities), leading to excessive anterior bending of the lumbar spine, surgical treatment can be considered to relieve pain and improve labor capacity. Surgeries include joint debridement, dermal embedding plastic surgery, and other orthopedic procedures, primarily the former, involving the removal of excess bone growth, removal of loose bodies, and smoothing of uneven articular cartilage surfaces. Orthopedic surgeries for severe joint deformities, contractures, or occasional joint entrapment, involving the removal of joint loose bodies and joint interior cleaning, and deformity correction, can achieve good results. Prognosis: If the disease is in the prodromal stage or stage I, moving away from endemic areas can often halt disease progression and lead to gradual recovery. At stage II, if the growth plate does not continue to calcify or ossify, the prognosis remains good. By stage III, once the growth plate has ossified, recovery is challenging. The disease does not pose a direct threat to life, allowing for a normal lifespan, and does not significantly affect reproductive capabilities in both sexes, but it can significantly impact labor capacity.\",\n          \"Treatment options for infectious abdominal aortic aneurysm include surgical intervention and targeted antibiotic therapy. Indications for considering this condition include prolonged fever of unknown origin, recurrent bacteremia, rapid increase in aneurysm size, and lack of calcification in the aneurysm wall.\\nSurgical treatment is imperative to prevent rupture due to the explosive nature of the infection. Purely antibiotic treatment is insufficient to reduce the risk of rupture. Surgical approach involves resection of the infected aneurysm, thorough debridement of adjacent necrotic tissues, and implantation of a prosthetic graft through an anatomical or extra-anatomical route.\\nSurgical techniques include a midline abdominal incision exposing the aneurysmatic aorta, sometimes accompanied by perianeurysmal abscess formation. Proximal control of the aortic neck and, if necessary, occlusion of the aorta at the level of the diaphragmatic crus to minimize mobilization due to the fragility of the infected aneurysm. Iliac arteries are then isolated and transected, followed by excision of the infected aneurysm. Thorough debridement of necrotic tissue is conducted, with irrigation using antibiotic-soaked saline. A prosthetic vascular graft, preferably made of ePTFE due to its enhanced infection resistance, is implanted either through the anatomical path or an alternative route if the arterial blood supply to vital organs is compromised.\\nPerioperative management involves immediate initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, later adjusted based on culture and sensitivity tests. For Salmonella infections, antibiotics with a longer half-life are preferred, with treatment duration typically ranging from 6 to 8 weeks. In cases of significant periaortic abscess formation or Gram-positive bacterial infection, complete removal of the aneurysm and necrotic material is followed by closure of the aortic stump with non-absorbable vascular sutures. The aortic edges are ensured to be free of infection, occasionally verified through frozen section analysis. Omentoplasty and axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting are employed to maintain blood supply to the lower limbs.\\nPerioperative care emphasizes the correction of anemia, nutritional support, immunological function enhancement, and close monitoring of vital organ functions. Considering the risk of recurrence and complications post-surgery, meticulous follow-up is essential for timely management.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

            " The primary treatment involves symptomatic care, including antipyretic analgesics for fever and pain relief, and prevention of secondary bacterial infections. Amantadine and rimantadine can block viral replication, offering preventive and therapeutic effects against Influenza A, with the latter having fewer side effects. The dosage is 200mg daily for adults (2.5mg/kg). This can shorten the course of illness and reduce viral shedding. Treatment should commence within the first day of symptom onset and continue for 3 to 5 days. In the event of an Influenza A outbreak, prophylactic use should be considered for susceptible individuals, including the elderly (especially those living in nursing homes), patients with chronic heart, lung, kidney diseases, individuals taking immunosuppressive drugs, hospitalized patients, and healthcare workers. Side effects may include headache, excitement, dizziness, and ataxia. \n",
